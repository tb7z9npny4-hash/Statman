            <p class="subtitle">Why Liverpool Suddenly Clicked: A Data-Driven Breakdown</p>
            <p class="meta">February 17, 2026 • FA Cup Fifth Round • Match Analysis</p>
        </div>

        <div class="scoreline">3 - 0</div>
        <div class="goal-info">
            Jones 42' • Szoboszlai 56' • Salah 68' (Pen)
        </div>

        <h2>The Paradox: Brighton Had More Possession & More Shots</h2>
        
        <p>Liverpool beat Brighton 3-0 in the FA Cup fifth round, but the underlying numbers tell a fascinating story. Brighton had <span class="stat-highlight">53% possession</span> and <span class="stat-highlight">18 total shots</span> compared to Liverpool's 13. They also completed more passes (449 vs 391) and had more shots outside the box (8 vs 2).</p>

        <p>So how did Liverpool win 3-0? <strong>Liverpool didn't need to dominate the ball. They dominated the moments that mattered.</strong></p>

        <div class="stat-box">
            <strong>Key Statistical Comparison:</strong><br>
            Brighton: 53% possession, 18 shots, 1.29 xG<br>
            Liverpool: 47% possession, 13 shots, 2.00 xG<br>
            Liverpool xG on Target: 2.30 vs Brighton's 0.25
        </div>

        <h2>Clinical Efficiency - xG Tells the Real Story</h2>

        <p>Liverpool's xG was <span class="stat-highlight">2.00</span> against Brighton's <span class="stat-highlight">1.29</span>. Despite having fewer shots, Liverpool generated higher quality chances. Their shots inside the box numbered 11 compared to Brighton's 10, but crucially Liverpool had <strong>5 shots on target vs Brighton's 3</strong>.</p>

        <p>Most tellingly, their xG on target (xGOT) was a massive <span class="stat-highlight">2.30 vs Brighton's 0.25</span>, meaning Liverpool's shots were not just on target, they were dangerous shots on target. Brighton had volume but no quality in the final moment.</p>

        <h2>Salah Was Unstoppable</h2>

        <p>Mohamed Salah rated <span class="stat-highlight">9.05</span> (Player of the Match) and the stats back it up entirely:</p>

        <div class="two-column">
            <div>
                <strong>Salah's Performance:</strong>
                <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">
                    <li>5 total shots</li>
                    <li>4 chances created</li>
                    <li>1.04 xG on his own</li>
                    <li>3 successful dribbles</li>
                    <li>1 assist (Szoboszlai goal)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>When Salah is in this kind of form pressing, dribbling, shooting, creating Liverpool's attack operates at a completely different level. In their bad recent games, Salah was either isolated or out of form. Here, the structure fed him constantly.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Brighton's Discipline Collapsed</h2>

        <p>Brighton picked up <span class="stat-highlight">4 yellow cards</span> (Dunk 15', Diego Gomez 33', Baleba 41', van Hecke 67') and Liverpool had <strong>zero</strong>. Three of those yellows came before halftime, which means Brighton's midfield and defence were already stretched and rattled.</p>

        <p>Baleba getting booked at 41' just before Jones scored at 42' is no coincidence. A disrupted, discipline-compromised Brighton defence was easier to break down.</p>

        <h2>Midfield Control Through Touches & Passing</h2>

        <p>Curtis Jones led all players with <span class="stat-highlight">71 touches</span>, level with Brighton's Pascal Gross, and Alexis Mac Allister had 70. Szoboszlai completed 47 passes. Liverpool's midfield was active, involved, and dictating the tempo even without dominating possession.</p>

        <p>In poor Liverpool performances, the midfield tends to go missing. Here Jones (scorer, 8.37 rating) and Szoboszlai (scorer, 8.40 rating) were both excellent.</p>

        <h2>Defensive Solidity</h2>

        <p>Liverpool kept Brighton completely off the scoresheet despite Brighton's 18 shots. The goalkeeper made <span class="stat-highlight">3 saves</span>, Liverpool made <span class="stat-highlight">26 clearances</span> (vs Brighton's 20), <span class="stat-highlight">7 blocks</span> (vs 6), and won <span class="stat-highlight">63% of aerial duels</span> (12 from 19).</p>

        <p>Brighton actually won more ground duels (51%), but Liverpool's aerial dominance likely through Van Dijk's presence prevented the kind of second-ball chaos that can turn games.</p>

        <div class="key-factors">
            <h3>Why This Game Was Different From Recent Poor Performances</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Salah fully engaged:</strong> He was the engine of everything going forward. When he's passive, Liverpool look toothless. Here he was relentless.</li>
                <li><strong>High-quality chances, not just high quantity:</strong> xGOT of 2.30 shows Liverpool shot with precision and power from dangerous positions.</li>
                <li><strong>Brighton self-destructed:</strong> 4 yellow cards disrupted their usual structured pressing, giving Liverpool more space to operate.</li>
                <li><strong>Midfield was alive:</strong> Jones and Szoboszlai both scored, both rated above 8.3, and both had huge touch counts.</li>
                <li><strong>Defensive command:</strong> Zero yellow cards, dominant aerially, 26 clearances. No anxiety at the back means freedom going forward.</li>
                <li><strong>Liverpool didn't panic about possession:</strong> Conceding the ball (47%) but still winning 3-0 shows mature, counter-pressing, transition-based football.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <strong>The Bottom Line:</strong> Liverpool 3-0 Brighton wasn't a performance about domination, it was about ruthlessness. Brighton had more of the ball, more shots, and more passes. But Liverpool had Salah on fire, a disciplined structure, and the clinical edge that turns xG into actual goals. The momentum swung in spikes, not sustained pressure, but devastating bursts at exactly the right moments. This is Slot's Liverpool at their best: compact, patient, and lethal when it counts.
